ArsTechnica (unofficial w/o permission) #Minecraft Pack
=======================================================
Hopefully this will work as a way for use to be able to work on our customized MC mod pack.
I know that technically it's not the proper way to do things, but since its going to be a private pack just for us in the thread, it should be ok.

I've reorganized how I'm uploading this, so it should work better with MultiMC


Installation Instructions 
---------------------------------------
    by Minstrel 

- Download the latest Release of the project from https://github.com/qchronod/ArsTechPack/releases
- Extract the ArsTech Pack folder
- Run MultiMC (http://forkk.net/MultiMC4.html)
- Click the Open Instance Folder button
- Move or copy ArsTech Pack folder into the Instance folder.
- Click the Refresh button in MultiMC and the instance will appear (ArsTech Pack)
- Before launching Minecraft, be sure that you have increased the amount of RAM available to Minecraft.  This mod pack requires a larger than standard amount of RAM to run properly.  In MultiMC, you may alter the amount of RAM allocated:
  - To all instances: in the Settings Dialog, under the Java Tab, in the Maximum Memory Allocation field.
  - To just one instance: from the instance Settings Dialog, available from the context menu of the instance. Otherwise, same as above.
- Also in the Java tab, enter "-XX:MaxPermSize=128m" in the JVM Arguments field
- Double click on the ArsTech Pack icon to launch Minecraft
- Check that MC says you have 11billion mods loaded, if not, check that forge .738 is in the instMods folder
- Log into the test server @ qchronod.diskstation.me:25565
- ?????
- Profit!!!
