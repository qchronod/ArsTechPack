Ars Technica (unofficial w/o permission) #Minecraft Pack
=======================================================

This is the Ars Technica Forum Minecraft Tech Pack for use on one of the private community servers.

We're now in feature freeze!  No more mods before we start playing for real, people!

*Important Notes:*
- No automated mining of the Overworld.  Use a Minecraft age, and keep the Overworld landscape clean.
- Do not run a quarry without chunk loading your processing facility.
- Don't use Mekanism Dynamic Tanks because they're crashy.  Store your liquids in Railcraft tanks.

Enough with the don'ts: 
- Please DO post issues on Github if you have problems.
- Log into IRC: irc.arstechnica.com #minecraft
- Dig deeper, build taller, and have fun.

  - To all instances: in the Settings Dialog, under the Java Tab, in the Maximum Memory Allocation field.
  - To just one instance: from the instance Settings Dialog, available from the context menu of the instance. Otherwise, same as above.
- Double click on the ArsTech Pack icon to launch Minecraft
- Check that MC says you have 11billion mods loaded, if not, check that forge .738 is in the instMods folder
- Log into the test server @ qchronod.diskstation.me:25565
- ?????
- Profit!!!
