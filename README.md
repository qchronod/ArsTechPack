Unofficial semi-private mod pack

Installation instructions
-------------------------
!!!!! MultiMC no longer works with 1.6 !!!!!!!

1. Download and run the new Mojang launcher so that all the normal files are around
2. Download and run the Forge 953 installer (and it should point to the default MC location)
3. Create a new profile in the Mojang launcher, and tell it to use the forge version you just installed
4. Run the new profile to make sure it's set up and says you have forge installed
5. Download and extract the latest test pack into the new profile folder (it has everything already in the approriate folders)
6. Log into the server
7. ????
8. PROFIT!!!


1.6.4 test builds
-----------------
Alpha 2

2013/11/27 - 2nd test build for the update. Added a bunch of mods, more to come after the holidays.


Alpha 1

2013/11/25 - inital client build is working. Currently have a test build up for download. 
That may or may not work w/o needing you to install forge first. Either way you will need a separate folder for the pack and to create a new version in the launcher pointing to it.
