ArsTechnica (unofficial w/o permission) #Minecraft Pack
=======================================================
Hopefully this will work as a way for use to be able to work on our customized MC mod pack.
I know that technically it's not the proper way to do things, but since its going to be a private pack just for us in the thread, it should be ok.

I've reorganized how I'm uploading this, so it should work better with MultiMC
